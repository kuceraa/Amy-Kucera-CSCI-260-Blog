    <h1> Chapter 1 </h1>
  </body>
  <p> The section that struck me the most was the section entitled "Your Knowledge Portfolio". As a math major, math concepts do not change very often. 1 + 1 will always equal 2. So once you learn the basic facts, all you need to do is make sure you remeber those facts. However, after reading this section, I understood the importance of always updating your portfolio when it comes to software. Today, technology is changing every day, and it is important to stay up to date.</p>
    
  <p>The author of the textbook argues that knowledge and experience falls under the category of "expiring assets". Once you    learn a topic, that knowledge can only last so long until new information is released or a better version is produced. Once that happens, the knowledge you have is outdated. So, the author provides steps on how to keep your portfolio up to date. 
The author writes that building your knowledge portfolio is similar to how investors manage their portfolio: invest regularly, diversify, manage risk, buy low/sell high, and review/rebalance. In order to reach these goals, the other provides examples such as reading books, lerning new programming languages, and taking classes. I think the goal that spoke to me the most was reading a technical book each quarter. Before college, I loved to read. I always tried to read a new book every few months. However, once I got to college, I read fewer and fewer books just because of my busy schedule. I would try to read a technical book or even a fun book, but then I have to focus on busy work that I needed to get done for my classes. Additionally, I found it difficult to find the right technical books to read.</p>

  <p>This past summer I created a LinkedIn profile in order to start applying for summer internships. As I started making connections, I was able to see posts people were making about upcoming technology and ways to improve your coding skills. By making these connections, I gained access to people working in the field that I aspire to work in and also to their posts that they share about how to expand your knowledge portfolio. As I think about ways to improve my portfolio, I think the articles and posts on LinkedIn are going to replace technical books. By using LinkedIn, you don't have to search for the right books to read. You have various articles right at your disposal that are posted by people who have experience working in that field. These articles not only help expand your portfolio, but they can also inspire different topics to explore more in depth.</p>
  
  <p>So as I think about the best way to expand your knowledge portfolio, I think social media will become an important factor. Social media not only works as a way expand your network, but it also allows you to gain helpful tips and advice on topics to study that best apply to your field of interest. So, I think it is going to become easier and easier to expand your portfolio because of the increased access to knowledge and advice.</p>

  <p> For the log in page, I started with the welcome screen where the user indicates whether he/she is an administrator or volunteer. An administrator will use his/her email given by the organization while the volunteer will use his/her email and password that they used when they first signed up. I created two different screens: one for the volunteer log in and one for the admin log in.

  <p> The first screen allows the user to choose what he/she wants to do (sign up for an event, change roles for an event, cancel sign up for an event). Based on which link the user picks, the user will be directed to the appropriate screen. The cancel screen is pretty simple. The user needs to select the event and role they signed up for and then briefly explain their reason for cancelling. The change role screen is also pretty simple. The user needs to select the event and current role they signed up for. The last step is to select the new role that he/she wants to sign up for. The sign up screen is a little more involved. The first part asks if the user is signing up a group. If yes, then the user is directed to a new screen asking the user to enter the info of each volunteer. Otherwise, the user will enter their personal info needed by the admins and then select the event and role they would like to volunteer for. For all three options, the user will be asked at the end how he/she would like to be notified of their action (by either phone or email confirmation).
