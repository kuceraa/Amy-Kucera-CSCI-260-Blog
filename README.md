    <h1> Chapter 1 </h1>

  <p> The section that struck me the most was the section entitled "Your Knowledge Portfolio". As a math major, math concepts do not change very often. 1 + 1 will always equal 2. So once you learn the basic facts, all you need to do is make sure you remeber those facts. However, after reading this section, I understood the importance of always updating your portfolio when it comes to software. Today, technology is changing every day, and it is important to stay up to date.

<p> The author of the textbook argues that knowledge and experience falls under the category of "expiring assets". Once you learn a topic, that knowledge can only last so long until new information is released or a better version is produced. Once that happens, the knowledge you have is outdated. So, the author provides steps on how to keep your portfolio up to date.
